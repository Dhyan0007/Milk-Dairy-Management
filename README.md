# Milk-Dairy-Management

Dairy Distribution is a specialized system used to keep track of all the various functions of
milk distributors among the Dairies. It's a full-featured website that bends over backwards to
give you the flexibility you need to run your Dairy. The basic concept of this Website is to
allow each of the Dairy managers to maintain their dairy reports by storing it in the system.
This website helps in controlling all the dairies in and around the area to prevent from extra
dairy production. And the admin can easily control over all the dairies. Our main goal to
develop this application to encourage a dairy industry. Dairy database management is a
software application to maintain day to day transactions in a Milk Distributor Office. This
software help to register all the suppliers, Buyer details, purchase, Sales details, feed details.
The project entitled dairy database management is a pilot project for new Milk Distributor to
be start soon in the city. The management planned this Milk Distribution center to operate on
the next month. They have a big plan to collect the Milks from many different sources and
distribute the same for the Milk buyers. This website is built such a way that it should suits for
all type of Milk Distributors in future. So every effort is taken to implement this project in this
Milk Distributing Office, on successful implementation in this Dairy Distributors Office, we
can target other Milk Distributors in the city An SRS is basically an organization’s
understanding (in writing) of customers or potential client’s system requirements and
dependencies at a particular point intime (usually) prior to any actual design or development
work. It’s a two- way distribution system that assures both the admin and the dairy
understand the other’s requirements from that perspective at a given point in time.
